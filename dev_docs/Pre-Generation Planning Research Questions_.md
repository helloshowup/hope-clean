## **Architecting the Planning Prompt: From High-Level Concepts to Structured Blueprints**

The foundational challenge in moving to a plan-then-generate workflow is the reliable generation of a structured plan from a high-level topic. This requires moving beyond simple instructions to construct a robust prompting methodology that ensures consistency, detail, and adherence to a predefined schema. The approach detailed here treats the prompt not as a conversational question but as a formal technical specification, ensuring that interactions with the Large Language Model (LLM) are predictable and suitable for a production environment.

### **Foundational Principles of Structured Prompt Engineering for Planning**

The core philosophy for generating structured outputs is to treat the prompt as a contract with the LLM. This contract explicitly defines the terms of the engagement (the model's role, the context, and any constraints), the required deliverables (the plan), and the acceptance criteria (the output format, such as JSON). This reframes the interaction from a casual request to a formal specification, which is more aligned with engineering best practices. A failure by the model to adhere to the specified format can be treated as a "breach of contract," which should programmatically trigger error handling or a retry mechanism. This mindset elevates the developer's function from a "prompt writer" to a "prompt architect," who designs a resilient and unambiguous specification rather than simply asking a question.

A comprehensive prompt architecture must integrate multiple components to guide the model effectively. These components include clear instructions, relevant context, illustrative examples (few-shot learning), a specific question or task, a well-defined role for the model to assume, and explicit formatting cues.1 Of these, clarity and specificity are paramount; any ambiguity in the prompt can lead to unpredictable or incorrect outputs from the LLM.1 A proven strategy for maintaining high quality when dealing with complex tasks, such as generating an entire video script, is to decompose the task into smaller, more manageable steps.3 The plan-then-generate approach is a direct application of this principle, where the complex task of "create a video script" is broken down into two simpler, sequential tasks: "create a detailed plan" and "generate script content based on the plan."

### **Comparative Analysis of Prompting Techniques for Script Outlining**

Several techniques can be employed to instruct an LLM to generate a structured plan. The selection and combination of these techniques directly impact the reliability and consistency of the output.

#### **Clear Format Specification & Role-Playing**

This is the most direct technique, involving explicit instructions for the model to adopt a specific persona and return its output in a predefined format, typically JSON.5 Assigning a role, such as "You are an expert educational video script planner," primes the model with the necessary domain context, tone, and style.8 This is often paired with an explicit command to "Return a JSON object that strictly adheres to the following schema," followed by a definition of the required keys and data types.7

While this method is simple to implement, it can be brittle when used in isolation. Models may still produce malformed JSON or include conversational filler (e.g., "Certainly, here is the JSON you requested...") that complicates programmatic parsing.6 Therefore, it should be considered a necessary but not sufficient component of a production-grade prompt.

#### **Few-Shot Learning (Providing Examples)**

Few-shot learning involves providing one or more complete, high-quality examples of the desired input-output pair within the prompt itself.1 For the task of video script planning, this would entail showing an example of a high-level

Content Outline and the corresponding structured Plan in the target JSON format.

This technique is exceptionally powerful for demonstrating complex data structures and nuanced content requirements. A single, well-chosen example is often more effective at conveying the desired output than pages of written instructions.3 However, this method increases the prompt's token count, leading to higher operational costs and consuming more of the model's limited context window. Furthermore, poorly selected or overly numerous examples can confuse the model and degrade performance.3

#### **Response Prefilling and Constrained Decoding**

This is a more advanced technique where the prompt is structured to guide the model into the desired format. For instance, ending the user's portion of the prompt with Assistant: { strongly signals that a JSON object is the expected response format.5 This is a form of response prefilling.

An even more robust evolution of this concept is constrained decoding. This method programmatically restricts the LLM's vocabulary at each step of generation to only those tokens that will maintain a valid structure, such as a syntactically correct JSON object.5 While this offers the highest degree of reliability for generating valid syntax, it requires more sophisticated tooling and is not a feature that is universally available across all LLM provider APIs.

### **Actionable Prompt Templates for Educational Video Plans**

The following templates synthesize the techniques discussed above into practical, actionable prompts. They are designed to reliably generate a plan that includes key talking points, visual cues, and timing allocations for an educational video script.

#### **Prompt Example 1: The Comprehensive JSON Specification Prompt**

This prompt relies heavily on role-playing and an explicit, detailed definition of the required JSON schema. It is direct and leaves little room for ambiguity in the output structure.

You are an expert educational content planner and scriptwriter, specializing in creating engaging and informative video content for YouTube. Your task is to take a high-level content outline and generate a detailed, structured plan for a 3-minute educational video.

The output MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object.

The JSON object must conform to the following schema:  
{  
  "video\_title": "string",  
  "target\_audience": "string",  
  "learning\_objective": "string",  
  "scenes": \[  
    {  
      "scene\_number": "integer",  
      "scene\_title": "string",  
      "estimated\_duration\_seconds": "integer",  
      "talking\_points": \[  
        "string \- A key point the narrator will discuss."  
      \],  
      "visual\_cues": \[  
        "string \- A description of the visuals, animations, or on-screen text for this scene."  
      \]  
    }  
  \]  
}

Here is the content outline to use for generation:  
\---  
Topic: The Basics of Photosynthesis  
Key Sections:  
1\.  Introduction: What is Photosynthesis?  
2\.  The Ingredients: Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide  
3\.  The Process: How Plants Make Food  
4\.  The Byproduct: Oxygen  
5\.  Conclusion: Why Photosynthesis is Important for Life on Earth  
\---

#### **Prompt Example 2: The Few-Shot Example-Driven Prompt**

This prompt is more concise in its direct instructions but provides a complete, one-shot example to demonstrate the expected content, style, and structure.

You are a scriptwriting assistant. Your task is to convert a content outline into a detailed JSON plan for a video. Follow the format of the example provided.

\#\#\# EXAMPLE \#\#\#  
Content Outline:  
Topic: The Water Cycle  
Key Sections: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Collection

JSON Plan:  
{  
  "video\_title": "The Incredible Journey of Water: Understanding the Water Cycle",  
  "target\_audience": "Middle school students (Ages 11-14)",  
  "learning\_objective": "Students will be able to describe the four main stages of the water cycle.",  
  "scenes":,  
      "visual\_cues":  
    },  
    {  
      "scene\_number": 2,  
      "scene\_title": "Evaporation: Water Turns to Vapor",  
      "estimated\_duration\_seconds": 45,  
      "talking\_points":,  
      "visual\_cues":  
    }  
  \]  
}  
\#\#\# END EXAMPLE \#\#\#

Now, generate a JSON plan for the following content outline.

Content Outline:  
Topic: The Basics of Photosynthesis  
Key Sections:  
1\.  Introduction: What is Photosynthesis?  
2\.  The Ingredients: Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide  
3\.  The Process: How Plants Make Food  
4\.  The Byproduct: Oxygen  
5\.  Conclusion: Why Photosynthesis is Important for Life on Earth

#### **Prompt Example 3: The Hybrid "CREATE" Method Prompt**

This prompt adapts a structured framework that combines role-playing, a clear request, and format definition, making it both robust and easily adaptable. It follows the principles of setting a Character, making a Request, and Telling the model the output format.12

\#\#\# CHARACTER \#\#\#  
You are an experienced strategic planning consultant and instructional designer, known for creating concise, impactful, and logically structured plans for educational videos. You specialize in breaking down complex scientific topics for a young audience.

\#\#\# REQUEST \#\#\#  
I need a detailed plan for an educational video based on the content outline I provide below. The plan should guide the entire video production process, from narration to visual design. It must be structured into logical scenes, each with clear talking points, suggestions for visual aids, and an estimated duration.

\#\#\# CONTENT OUTLINE \#\#\#  
Topic: The Basics of Photosynthesis  
Key Sections:  
1\.  Introduction: What is Photosynthesis?  
2\.  The Ingredients: Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide  
3\.  The Process: How Plants Make Food  
4\.  The Byproduct: Oxygen  
5\.  Conclusion: Why Photosynthesis is Important for Life on Earth

\#\#\# TELL (OUTPUT FORMAT) \#\#\#  
Create the plan as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text outside of the JSON object. The root of the object should contain 'video\_title', 'target\_audience', 'learning\_objective', and a 'scenes' array. Each object in the 'scenes' array must contain 'scene\_number', 'scene\_title', 'estimated\_duration\_seconds', an array of 'talking\_points', and an array of 'visual\_cues'.

### **Recommendation: A Hybrid Prompting Strategy for Consistent and Reliable Plan Generation**

For a production system, the recommended approach is the **Hybrid "CREATE" Method Prompt (Example 3\)**.

**Justification:** A simple format specification (Example 1\) is often too unreliable for automated workflows, as it is prone to syntax errors or the inclusion of extraneous text.5 A purely few-shot prompt (Example 2\) can be highly effective but is less flexible and more costly in terms of token usage. The hybrid approach offers an optimal balance. It provides the structural integrity and clarity of direct role-playing and explicit format definition, while being easily adaptable for different topics without requiring a new, full-text example each time. This combination of clear instructions and format specification has been shown to be highly effective.3 When this robust prompting strategy is paired with a reliable output validation layer, as will be discussed in the following section, it forms the basis of a fault-tolerant and production-ready system.5

## **The Data Bridge: Selecting and Implementing the Optimal Data Structure for Workflow Chaining**

The choice of data format for transferring the generated plan from the "planning" stage to the "generation" stage is a critical architectural decision. It directly influences the workflow's robustness, maintainability, and operational cost. The two primary candidates for this task are JSON and Markdown. While both can represent the required information, their inherent characteristics lead to significant differences in implementation complexity and reliability.

### **A Comparative Analysis: JSON vs. Markdown for Inter-Step Data Transfer**

The decision between JSON and Markdown involves a trade-off between token efficiency and parsing robustness. While Markdown is more compact, its loose structure introduces significant engineering challenges that are ill-suited for a reliable, automated production pipeline.

An initial analysis might simply weigh the lower API costs of Markdown's token efficiency against the development convenience of JSON. However, a more complete analysis must consider the total cost of ownership. This includes not only the predictable operational costs of API calls but also the unpredictable engineering costs associated with developing, debugging, and maintaining the system. An LLM's failure to generate perfectly structured Markdown—for example, by using inconsistent heading levels or broken list syntax—can cause the downstream Python parser to fail in subtle and hard-to-debug ways.13 This necessitates the creation of complex, fragile parsing logic and extensive error-handling routines.

In contrast, a failure to generate valid JSON is a binary condition that is easily and immediately caught by a standard parser like Python's json.loads().5 The strict, machine-readable nature of the JSON specification, when combined with a well-formed prompt, makes it more likely that the LLM will generate a syntactically valid output. Therefore, for a scalable and maintainable production workflow, prioritizing robustness and minimizing engineering overhead is the superior long-term strategy. The slightly higher token cost of JSON is a predictable and justifiable expense that purchases significant gains in system reliability and developer velocity.

The following table provides a detailed comparison of the two formats across key criteria for this use case.

| Criterion | JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) | Markdown | Technical Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Parsing Simplicity (Python)** | Excellent. Natively supported via the built-in json module. Deserialization is typically a single line of code.15 | Poor. Requires complex custom logic (e.g., regex, line-by-line state machines) or reliance on third-party libraries which may not perfectly match the LLM's output style.17 | JSON's direct mapping to Python dictionaries and lists makes it the path of least resistance and lowest code complexity. |
| **Robustness & Error Handling** | High. The format has a strict, unambiguous schema. Parsing fails loudly and immediately with a JSONDecodeError on any syntax error, making failures easy to catch and handle.5 | Low. The format is loosely structured and relies on convention. LLMs can easily introduce subtle formatting errors (e.g., wrong indentation, inconsistent headers) that can lead to silent failures or incorrect data extraction.13 | The strictness of JSON is a feature, not a bug, in an automated pipeline. It enforces data integrity and makes error detection trivial. |
| **Token Efficiency** | Fair. The syntax is verbose due to brackets, braces, and quoted keys, resulting in higher token consumption.13 | Excellent. The syntax is minimal, making it significantly more token-efficient. It can be 15-30% more efficient than JSON for the same data.19 | Markdown has a clear advantage in token cost. However, this advantage is outweighed by the costs associated with its lack of robustness. |
| **Hierarchical Data Representation** | Excellent. Natively supports deeply nested objects and arrays, which is ideal for representing the complex, hierarchical structure of a video script plan.14 | Poor. Hierarchy is represented by convention (e.g., heading levels, list indentation), which is difficult to parse programmatically and can be inconsistently generated by an LLM. | JSON is fundamentally designed for structured, hierarchical data, making it a perfect fit for the data model of a script plan. |
| **Ease of Integration** | Excellent. Directly deserializes into Python dictionaries and lists, which are the standard data structures for manipulation within the application.15 | Poor. Requires an intermediate parsing and transformation step to convert the Markdown structure into a usable Python dictionary, adding complexity and a potential point of failure.17 | JSON integrates seamlessly into a Python workflow, whereas Markdown requires a dedicated, custom-built integration layer. |

### **Implementation in Python: Parsing and Data Extraction**

The following code examples demonstrate the practical differences in parsing a JSON object versus a Markdown outline in Python.

#### **Code Implementation: Parsing a JSON Plan Object**

This example showcases the simplicity and robustness of parsing a JSON string using Python's built-in json library. The process, known as deserialization, converts the JSON string into a native Python dictionary.16

Python

import json

def parse\_json\_plan(json\_string: str) \-\> dict | None:  
    """

    Args:

    Returns:  
        A dictionary representing the plan, or None if parsing fails.  
    """  
    try:  
        \# The core of JSON parsing in Python.  
        \# json.loads() deserializes a string into a Python object.  
        plan\_dict \= json.loads(json\_string)  
        print("Successfully parsed JSON plan.")  
        \# Example of accessing a nested value  
        first\_scene\_title \= plan\_dict.get("scenes", \[{}\]).get("scene\_title", "N/A")  
        print(f"Title of first scene: {first\_scene\_title}")  
        return plan\_dict  
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:  
        \# This block catches any syntax errors in the JSON string,  
        \# making error handling straightforward and reliable.

        return None

invalid\_json\_plan \= """  
{

  \]  
}  
"""  
parse\_json\_plan(invalid\_json\_plan)

#### **Code Implementation: Parsing a Markdown-based Plan Outline (For Illustrative Purposes)**

To provide a direct contrast, the following conceptual example demonstrates the significantly higher complexity involved in parsing a Markdown outline into the same nested dictionary structure. This approach requires custom logic to interpret formatting cues like heading levels (\#, \#\#) and list items (-), making it inherently more fragile.21

Python

def parse\_markdown\_plan(markdown\_string: str) \-\> dict:  
    """

    NOTE: This is for demonstration only and is not robust for production.

    """  
    lines \= markdown\_string.strip().split('\\n')  
    plan \= {"scenes":}  
    current\_scene \= None  
    current\_section \= None

    for line in lines:  
        line \= line.strip()  
        if not line:  
            continue

        \# This logic is brittle and relies on strict formatting.  
        if line.startswith('\# '):  
            plan\['video\_title'\] \= line\[2:\].strip()  
        elif line.startswith('\#\# Scene:'):  
            if current\_scene:  
                plan\['scenes'\].append(current\_scene)  
            current\_scene \= {'scene\_title': line\[10:\].strip(), 'talking\_points':, 'visual\_cues':}

        elif line.startswith('- ') and current\_scene and current\_section:  
            \# This could easily fail if the list format is inconsistent.  
            current\_scene\[current\_section\].append(line\[2:\].strip())

    if current\_scene:  
        plan\['scenes'\].append(current\_scene)

    print("Parsed Markdown plan (best effort).")  
    return plan

print(parsed\_md\_plan)

### **Recommendation: Justifying the Selection of JSON for Robustness and Scalability**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the strong recommendation is to use **JSON** as the data transfer format between the 'planning' and 'generation' stages of the workflow.

**Justification:** While Markdown offers a tangible benefit in token efficiency 19, this advantage is decisively outweighed by the operational superiority of JSON in a production environment. JSON's native support in Python eliminates the need for complex, custom parsers, reducing development time and potential sources of error.15 Its strict schema enforcement and unambiguous representation of hierarchical data make it fundamentally more robust and less susceptible to the difficult-to-debug formatting inconsistencies that can arise from LLM generation.5 The "Total Cost of Ownership" analysis concludes that the predictable, marginal increase in API costs associated with JSON is a worthwhile investment to avoid the unpredictable and significantly higher engineering costs required to build and maintain a fragile, custom Markdown parsing solution.

## **Strategic Integration into the Python Workflow**

Integrating the new planning stage requires a thoughtful architectural approach to ensure the existing workflow.py remains maintainable, testable, and scalable. This section details the optimal software architecture pattern for this integration, with a specific focus on managing the state of the central row\_data\_item dictionary and handling errors gracefully.

### **Architectural Patterns for Workflow Extension: A Comparative Analysis**

Two primary architectural strategies exist for incorporating the new planning functionality: creating a distinct, modular stage or embedding the logic as a sub-task within the existing generation function.

#### **The Modular Stage Pattern: Decoupling Planning and Generation**

This pattern advocates for creating a new, self-contained function, such as run\_planning\_stage(row\_data\_item), which is executed sequentially before the existing generate\_content function (which would be refactored to a more specific name like run\_generation\_stage). This design aligns with established software engineering principles and workflow patterns like Task Chaining and the Template Method, where a process is defined as a sequence of distinct, interchangeable steps.23

The primary strength of this approach is the clear separation of concerns. Each stage (planning, generation, and potentially refinement) becomes an independently testable, maintainable, and debuggable unit. This modularity isolates failures effectively; an error during the planning stage prevents the unnecessary execution of the generation stage, saving computational resources and making the point of failure immediately obvious.25 This design also provides a clean and scalable foundation for adding future stages to the workflow, such as the AI-powered refinement loop discussed in the next section. The main drawback is the need for some initial refactoring of the existing workflow logic to accommodate the sequential execution of distinct stages.

#### **The Embedded Sub-Task Pattern: Integrating Planning within generate\_content**

This alternative approach involves adding the planning logic directly at the beginning of the existing generate\_content function. The function would first call the LLM to generate a plan, parse it, and then immediately use that plan to guide the remainder of its execution within the same functional scope.

The main advantage of this pattern is that it can be quicker to implement initially, as it is less disruptive to the existing high-level function call structure. However, this convenience comes at a significant long-term cost. It results in a large, monolithic function that violates the Single Responsibility Principle by being responsible for both planning and generation. Such functions are notoriously difficult to test, debug, and maintain.26 Error handling becomes more complex, often requiring deeply nested

try-except blocks that obscure the function's primary logic.

### **State and Error Management for the row\_data\_item Dictionary**

As the row\_data\_item dictionary is passed between stages, its role evolves from a simple data container to a comprehensive state object. Proper management of this state is critical for the observability and reliability of the entire workflow.

By treating the row\_data\_item as a representation of a state machine, we can introduce explicit fields to track the progress and health of each work unit as it moves through the pipeline. In a single-step process, the only states required might be "pending" and "complete" or "failed." However, a multi-stage workflow necessitates a more granular state model. Adding keys such as plan\_status, plan\_data, generation\_status, and error\_log to the row\_data\_item allows for precise tracking of where a failure occurred and why. This approach transforms the dictionary from a simple pass-through object into a rich, auditable record of the workflow's execution history, which is invaluable for production monitoring, debugging, and system analysis.27

#### **Ensuring State Integrity Across Sequential Stages**

To maintain data integrity and prevent unintended side effects, each stage in the workflow should be designed as a pure function. A pure function's output depends only on its input arguments, and it does not modify any state outside of its scope. In this context, each workflow stage (e.g., run\_planning\_stage) should accept the row\_data\_item dictionary as input and return a *modified copy* of it as output.30 This practice makes the data flow explicit and predictable.

The main workflow orchestrator is responsible for chaining these stages together, passing the output of one stage to the input of the next. For example:

Python

\# In the main workflow orchestrator  
row\_data\_item \= run\_planning\_stage(row\_data\_item)  
if row\_data\_item\['status'\] \== 'PLAN\_COMPLETE':  
    row\_data\_item \= run\_generation\_stage(row\_data\_item)

Within each stage, state updates should be explicit. The run\_planning\_stage function would be responsible for adding the generated plan to the dictionary under a specific key (e.g., row\_data\_item\['plan'\] \= generated\_plan) and updating a status key to reflect its completion (e.g., row\_data\_item\['status'\] \= 'PLAN\_COMPLETE').

#### **Robust Error Handling and Fallback Strategies**

A robust workflow must anticipate and gracefully handle failures at each stage. Each modular stage should be wrapped in its own try-except block.27 When an exception is caught, it should be logged, and the relevant error information should be written into the

row\_data\_item before the function terminates.

For instance, an exception occurring within run\_planning\_stage would trigger the except block, which would update the dictionary with row\_data\_item\['status'\] \= 'PLAN\_FAILED' and populate a new key, row\_data\_item\['error\_message'\] \= str(e). The main orchestrator can then inspect this status and decide to skip the generation stage for that particular item, preventing a cascade of failures. For batch processing scenarios, this aligns perfectly with the Error Aggregation pattern, allowing the system to continue processing other items while collecting a list of all failed row\_data\_item objects for later analysis and reprocessing.32

### **Recommendation: A Modular Integration Strategy for Maintainability and Testability**

The strong recommendation is to adopt the **Modular Stage Pattern (3.1.1)** for integrating the new planning phase.

**Justification:** Despite requiring more significant upfront refactoring, this approach yields substantial long-term benefits in system maintainability, testability, and scalability. It creates a clean, decoupled architecture where each component of the workflow can be developed, tested, and improved in isolation. This modularity is a hallmark of modern data pipeline best practices and provides a resilient and extensible foundation for future enhancements, including the AI-driven refinement loop that will be detailed in the subsequent section.26

## **Implementing an AI-Powered Plan Refinement Loop**

To further enhance the quality of the generated content, an automated, AI-powered refinement loop can be integrated into the workflow. This process uses a second AI call to critique and improve the initial plan, ensuring it is well-aligned with pedagogical goals and audience needs before the final content is generated. This section details a practical, two-step process for implementing such a loop.

### **A Survey of Practical Self-Correction and Refinement Techniques**

The concept of AI self-correction, also known as self-refinement, involves an LLM iteratively improving its own output.34 The techniques for achieving this range from simple re-prompting (e.g., "That's not right, try again") to highly structured, multi-step methods. One advanced technique is Chain-of-Verification (CoVe), where the model is prompted to generate and answer a series of verification questions to critique its own work before finalizing an answer.34

A critical bottleneck in any self-correction process is the model's ability to first detect an error or a qualitative weakness in its own output.35 Performance is significantly improved when the evaluation is guided by external tools or a clear, objective set of criteria. Breaking down a complex request into smaller, focused steps—such as "generate a plan" and then "critique the plan"—makes the refinement process more manageable and effective.36 This approach is a form of prompt chaining, where the output of one prompt (the initial plan) becomes a key input for a subsequent prompt (the critique).37

### **Designing a Two-Step Critique-and-Refine Loop**

A simple yet powerful refinement loop can be designed using a "Planner-Critic" pattern. A known challenge with self-correction is "self-bias," where a model may be overly confident in its initial output, even if it is flawed.35 By structuring the refinement process as an interaction between two distinct AI "agents"—a Planner and a Critic—a more objective evaluation can be enforced.

In this pattern, the Critic agent is given a different persona (e.g., "Expert Instructional Designer") and a different set of instructions, including a specific evaluation rubric or "constitution." This forces the evaluation to be based on external, objective criteria, such as a predefined Learner Profile, rather than on the Planner's internal generation process. This multi-agent or multi-prompt approach is a recurring theme in advanced prompting strategies and is a practical implementation of a formal feedback loop.37 This pattern creates a system of checks and balances within the AI workflow, leading to a more robust and higher-quality final plan.

#### **The "Planner" Agent: Generating the Initial Draft**

* **Role:** This is the first LLM call in the refinement loop. It uses the hybrid prompt architecture recommended in Section 1\.  
* **Input:** The high-level Content Outline for the video.  
* **Output:** The initial, structured plan in the specified JSON format.

#### **The "Critic" Agent: Evaluating the Plan Against a Learner Profile**

* **Role:** This is the second LLM call. The prompt assigns it the persona of an "Expert Instructional Designer" or a "Curriculum Specialist."  
* **Input:** The initial plan (JSON object) generated by the Planner agent, along with the Learner Profile and any other specific evaluation criteria.  
* **Task:** The Critic is instructed to evaluate the provided plan against the given criteria and then output a structured critique along with a revised, improved version of the plan.  
* **Output:** A single JSON object containing two keys: critique (a string containing the qualitative feedback) and revised\_plan (the full, improved plan, adhering to the original JSON format).

### **Documented Example: A Concrete Prompt and Response Flow for Plan Refinement**

The following example illustrates the complete two-step flow for the topic "The Water Cycle," targeting a young audience.

#### **Step 1: Planner Prompt and Output**

The Planner agent receives the prompt from Section 1.3 (Example 3), with the Content Outline set for "The Water Cycle." It produces an initial plan.

**Sample Planner Output (Initial Plan):**

JSON

{  
  "video\_title": "The Cycle of Water",  
  "target\_audience": "Elementary School Students",  
  "learning\_objective": "To understand the stages of the water cycle.",  
  "scenes":,  
      "visual\_cues":  
    },  
    {  
      "scene\_number": 2,  
      "scene\_title": "Evaporation",  
      "estimated\_duration\_seconds": 60,  
      "talking\_points":,  
      "visual\_cues": \[  
        "Animation of sun heating water.",  
        "Lines showing vapor rising."  
      \]  
    }  
  \]  
}

#### **Step 2: Critic Prompt and Output**

The Critic agent receives the initial plan from the Planner, along with a specific Learner Profile and evaluation criteria. Its task is to critique and refine this plan.

**Full Critic Prompt Text:**

You are an expert instructional designer and curriculum specialist, reviewing a video script plan. Your task is to critique the following plan and then provide a revised, improved version that is more engaging and effective for the target audience.

\#\#\# Evaluation Criteria \#\#\#  
1\.  \*\*Engagement:\*\* Is the language, pacing, and content interesting and relatable for the target audience?  
2\.  \*\*Clarity:\*\* Are complex concepts explained in a simple, easy-to-understand manner?  
3\.  \*\*Completeness:\*\* Does the plan cover all essential aspects of the topic logically?

\#\#\# Target Audience Profile \#\#\#  
Learners are 10-12 years old. They respond well to storytelling, dynamic visuals, and relatable analogies. They have short attention spans and benefit from clear, energetic pacing.

\#\#\# Plan to Review \#\#\#

\#\#\# Your Task \#\#\#  
Provide your response as a single, valid JSON object. The object must have two keys:  
1\.  \`critique\`: A string containing your detailed feedback on the original plan, referencing the evaluation criteria.  
2\.  \`revised\_plan\`: The full, improved plan in the original JSON format, incorporating your suggested changes.

**Sample Critic Output (Critique and Revised Plan):**

JSON

{  
  "critique": "The initial plan is factually correct but lacks engagement for the target 10-12 year old audience. The language is too simplistic ('water goes up'), and the visual cues are generic. It also misses the 'Collection' stage, making it incomplete. The revised plan uses a more engaging storytelling frame ('Water's Great Adventure'), simplifies complex terms with analogies, adds more dynamic visual suggestions, and includes the missing 'Collection' stage to provide a complete picture.",  
  "revised\_plan": {  
    "video\_title": "Water's Great Adventure: The Story of the Water Cycle",  
    "target\_audience": "Curious minds aged 10-12",  
    "learning\_objective": "To visualize and explain the four key stages of the water cycle as a continuous journey.",  
    "scenes":,  
        "visual\_cues": \[  
          "Fast-paced montage: a dinosaur drinking from a lake, a modern city skyline in the rain, a glass of water.",  
          "Animated title: 'Water's Great Adventure'.",  
          "A cute, animated water droplet character appears and waves."  
        \]  
      },  
      {  
        "scene\_number": 2,  
        "scene\_title": "The Great Escape (Evaporation)",  
        "estimated\_duration\_seconds": 45,  
        "talking\_points":,  
        "visual\_cues":  
      },  
      {  
        "scene\_number": 3,  
        "scene\_title": "Cloud Party (Condensation)",  
        "estimated\_duration\_seconds": 45,  
        "talking\_points":,  
        "visual\_cues":  
      }  
    \]  
  }  
}

This two-step refinement loop transforms a basic, factual plan into a pedagogically sound and engaging blueprint, significantly increasing the quality of the final video script.

## **Advanced Techniques for Ensuring Content Novelty and Preventing Repetition**

A common failure mode in generative AI is the production of repetitive or redundant content, particularly in multi-part documents. To ensure that each section of the educational video script—such as the hook, introduction, and summary—is distinct and serves its unique purpose, a layered strategy is required. This strategy combines architectural design, instructional prompting, and API parameter tuning to create a robust defense against repetition.

### **Contextual Prompting: Leveraging Generation History to Inform Future Steps**

The most effective method for preventing repetition between distinct sections is an architectural one: contextual prompting within a sequential workflow. In this approach, the output of a previously generated step is explicitly passed as context to the prompt for the subsequent step. This allows the model to be aware of what has already been written, enabling it to build upon, rather than repeat, existing content.

This technique helps the model maintain coherence across the entire script.40 To manage the context window and token costs effectively, it is often better to provide a concise summary of previous sections rather than including them verbatim, especially for longer documents.41 Research on LLM behavior also highlights a "Serial Position Effect," where information placed at the beginning and end of a prompt is given more weight.40 Therefore, the context and the instruction to avoid repetition should be placed strategically at the start or end of the prompt for maximum impact.

**Example Prompt Snippet (for generating a video summary):**

You are a professional scriptwriter tasked with writing a compelling summary for an educational video.

\#\#\# PREVIOUSLY GENERATED CONTENT (FOR CONTEXT) \#\#\#  
Hook: "Did you know that the water you drink today might have been sipped by a dinosaur millions of years ago?"  
Introduction: "In this video, we embark on an incredible journey to uncover the secrets of the water cycle, Earth's amazing recycling system. We'll explore how water travels from the ground to the sky and back again, ensuring life can thrive on our planet."

\#\#\# YOUR TASK \#\#\#  
Write a fresh and concise summary for the end of the video. Your summary should synthesize the core ideas of the water cycle into a new, memorable conclusion. \*\*Do not repeat the phrasing or specific examples from the hook or introduction provided above.\*\* Your goal is to leave the viewer with a lasting understanding of the topic's importance.

This prompt structure (combining ideas from 4) provides clear context and an explicit, positive directive to create novel content.

### **The Role of Negative Constraints and Explicit Instructions**

While contextual prompting is an architectural solution, instructional techniques within the prompt itself also play a crucial role. This involves telling the model precisely what to do and, sometimes, what not to do. However, research indicates that LLMs often struggle to correctly interpret negative instructions (e.g., "don't do X").43 The act of processing the negative command can paradoxically increase the model's attention on the very concept it is supposed to avoid, a phenomenon observed in both human psychology and LLM behavior.45

Consequently, positive framing is a more reliable and effective strategy. A negative prompt like, "Do not restate the main points verbatim in the summary," requires the model to first consider the action of restating points and then attempt to negate it. A positively framed prompt, such as, "Write a fresh summary that synthesizes the core ideas into a new, concise conclusion," directs the model's focus squarely on the desired positive action (synthesis and novelty) from the outset.43 Therefore, the prompting strategy should consistently favor positive, affirmative directives over negative constraints.

### **Strategic Use of API Parameters: frequency\_penalty and presence\_penalty**

As a final, statistical-level safeguard, the LLM API's decoding parameters can be tuned to discourage repetition. These parameters should be used as a backstop to complement strong architectural and prompting strategies, not as the primary solution.

* **frequency\_penalty**: This parameter applies a penalty to tokens based on how frequently they have already appeared in the generated text (including the prompt). A higher value (e.g., 0.5) more strongly discourages the model from reusing the same words.46  
* **presence\_penalty**: This parameter applies a flat, one-time penalty to any token that has already appeared in the text, regardless of its frequency. This specifically encourages the model to introduce new words and concepts, enhancing lexical diversity.46

For the task of generating distinct script sections, applying a small to moderate value for these penalties (e.g., frequency\_penalty=0.3, presence\_penalty=0.2) can effectively reduce subtle, low-level repetition. This helps prevent the model from falling into repetitive loops without stifling its ability to use important keywords when necessary.

### **A Unified Strategy for Minimizing Redundancy Across the Script**

A truly robust defense against content repetition requires a multi-layered approach that addresses the problem at the architectural, instructional, and statistical levels.

1. **Architectural Layer:** Implement a sequential, chained-prompt workflow. The output of each generation step (e.g., the hook) must be passed as contextual input to the prompt for the subsequent step (e.g., the introduction).  
2. **Instructional Layer:** Utilize contextual prompting with a strong emphasis on positive framing. For each new section, provide a summary of the previously generated content and instruct the model to "build upon," "expand from," or "synthesize" that context, rather than simply telling it not to repeat.  
3. **API Tuning Layer:** Apply a low-to-moderate frequency\_penalty (e.g., 0.3) and presence\_penalty (e.g., 0.2) to all content generation API calls. This acts as a final safeguard against verbatim repetition and encourages lexical novelty.

By implementing this unified strategy, the workflow can reliably produce video scripts where each section is distinct, serves its intended purpose, and contributes to a cohesive and non-redundant final product.
