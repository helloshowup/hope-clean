EXCEL_CLARIFICATION = (
    "IMPORTANT: Any mention of 'Excel' refers to Excel High School, the name of the school - "
    "NOT Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software. Course names like 'Excel Student Orientation' "
    "refer to orientation for students at Excel High School, not tutorials about Microsoft Excel."
